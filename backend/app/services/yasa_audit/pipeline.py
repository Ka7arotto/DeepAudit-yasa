"""Entry-first audit: route reconnaissance, then one review per entry point.

recon  : an agent works out how requests reach code in THIS project (directory layout, codegraph's route
         evidence, navigation tools), writes extractor programs that enumerate every entry, and checks
         them (handlers resolve to code, sampled entries read correctly, request-reading code is reachable
         from some entry). Output: entries.json.
         In parallel, an agent maps what is worth protecting (assets.py): recipes for a fixed set of classes of
         sensitive operation, expanded over the project and placed in the call graph, and the identity
         subsystems. Output: assets.json.
review : three kinds of unit, each in a fresh context, sharing verified facts and root causes:
         - entry: entries sharing one handler; what it does, who can call it, its access-control verdict,
           risks plausible for that function, each traced to a confirmed path or rejected;
         - operation: a function performing sensitive operations outside any handler, reviewed backward
           to every path that reaches it (entries, hooks, render pipelines) or, with no caller in the
           repository, as an extension point used the way the project documents it;
         - design: one identity subsystem against a fixed checklist; answers form a design worksheet.
