"""What is worth protecting: sensitive operations and identity subsystems, mapped once per project.

Entry-first review starts where requests come in and reads forward. It stops at the first sanitizer,
does not see code that no route reaches directly (render pipelines, hooks, extension points), and judges
one route at a time, never the design of a module. This stage maps the other end, so the review can
also start there:

operations  A fixed set of classes of harmful operation (OP_CLASSES). They describe effects, not
            frameworks. An agent finds how THIS project performs each class: the sensitive fields of
            its data model, the guards the project applies itself (permission and ownership checks,
            escaping, allowlists), the helpers the operations go through. It writes each form as a
            declarative recipe: a search pattern and, optionally, the project's guard for it. The
            executor here expands a recipe over the whole project and places every site in the call
            graph. It reports which entries reach the site, whether anything calls it at all (an
            extension point), and whether the guard is on the way. The agent refines its recipes on
            these counters, the same way it refines extractors on coverage. Each site becomes part of
            a review unit that works backward from the operation to every way of reaching it.
identity    The subsystems that create or prove an identity (registration, login, recovery, SSO,
            tokens, account linking, user management), each with its routes, files, models and
            settings. Each subsystem gets one design review against a fixed checklist
            (IDENTITY_CHECKLIST). The flaws in these subsystems sit in how the parts fit together,
            not on one route.

Everything in this module is deterministic: the agents decide what to look for, and this code
expands it and does the counting.
